Given an array, write a program to generate a random permutation of array elements. This question is also asked as
“shuffle a deck of cards” or “randomize a given array”



import random
def randomize(arr,n):
    for i in range(n-1,0,-1):
        j=random.randint(i+1)
        arr[i],arr[j]=arr[j],arr[i]
    return arr
